# Rust 101

## Basic syntax

* put function body opening bracket on same line as function declaration
* use 4 spaces indentation, not tab
* ending a declaration with ! means you call a rust macro

## Build system and package manager Cargo

* cargo new <project> creates the project directory, config file and sample main.rs
* cargo test runs all tests in the project
* cargo doc creates documentation from the source (everything marked with /// can be edited in markdown format)
